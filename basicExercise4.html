  <h3> Octupus's Garden </h3>
      <div> <p>I'd like to be under the sea <br>
              In an octopus's garden in the shade <br>
              He'd let us in, knows where we've been <br>
              In his octopus's garden in the shade <br> </p> </div>

  <div> <p> I'd ask my friends to come and see<br>
            An octopus's garden with me<br>
            I'd like to be under the sea<br>
            In an octopus's garden in the shade<br> </p> </div>

  <div> <p> We would be warm below the storm<br>
            In our little hideaway beneath the waves<br>
            Resting our head on the sea bed<br>
            In an octopus's garden near a cave<br> </p> </div>
  
  <div> <p> We would sing and dance around<br>
            Because we know we can't be found<br>
            I'd like to be under the sea<br>
            In an octopus's garden in the shade<br> </p> </div>

  <div> <p> We would shout and swim about<br>
            The coral that lies beneath the waves<br>
            (Lies beneath the ocean waves)<br>
            Oh what joy for every girl and boy<br>
            Knowing they're happy and they're safe<br>
            (Happy and they're safe)<br> </p> </div>

  <div> <p> We would be so happy you and me<br>
            No one there to tell us what to do<br>
            I'd like to be under the sea<br>
            In an octopus's garden with you<br>
            In an octopus's garden with you<br>
            In an octopus's garden with you<br> </p> </div>
